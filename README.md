MY_PROJECT_PORTFOLIO


TECHNOLOGIES USED

The main technologies used in this project were 
- HTML 
    This was used to set the structure of the page and also to segregate the page into 
    small parts in order to make my work much easier.
    I used elements like:
      -HEADER TAGS  to take care of all the heading visuals
      -SECTION TAGS to divide my page into fragments of the deck, timer and notifications
      -IMG TAGS to embed an avatar from a generator function I bult
      -FOOTER took care of the game's control buttons
     
    
- CSS
    This was used to style the whole page. One thing worth noting is the fact that the cards
    used were built using css. Among the data Attributes I used include :
        width: 100%;
        border, display
        justify-content
        align-items
        font-size
        border-radius
        color
        user-select
     The idea of creating canvas in CSS was used to creat a function that genearates an avatar, which will be modified later
      
      
- JAVASCRIPT
    This is by far the working block of the page, which controls all that is viewed and manipulated on the page.
    Among the great sections of JS I implemented were:
        - OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING :
              Which was used to dynamically build cards with their values and colours.  
              The constructor functions came in very handy too, where I merged ideas of loops and DOM manipulations to achieve my results
        - SCOPING :
              The idea od scoping in Javascript also came very handy since most of my variables were declared with all of that in mind
        - INBUILT PROPERTIES:
              the use of inbuilt properties and methods helped me in rendering iformation to the page without any hustle.
              It is great to note that , I came across different methods that JS offers that i had never head of which made my game great in my opinion 
              and one of such methods is that ability to easily embed sound or music in the project.
        - EVENTLISTENERS:
              Event listeners were used to make buttons on the page functional to my expectation .
        - MISCELLANEOUS :
              The use of QUERYSELECTORS were very powerful in my case since all variables that were declared to render onto the page were done through 
              the use of that.
              A new thing that caught my attention whilse trying to figure out my way of declaring a winer was when the idea of using a time came, which
              let me to discover SETINTERVAL and its related manipulators.
